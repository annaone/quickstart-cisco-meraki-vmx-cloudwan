image::../docs/deployment_guide/images/meraki_cw_architecture.png[Architecture]

As shown in <<architecture1>>, this Quick Start sets up the following:

* Two highly available Transit VPCs in two separate regions.*
* Each VPC is configured with two AZs, each with a Meraki vMX appliance with internet access via an Internet Gateway (not shown).
* An AWS Cloud WAN Global Network and Core Network along with a Core Network Policy (CNP) that includes the routing policy.
** Core Network includes single SDWAN Segment but can be integrated into any Workload Segment provided by customer (not part of Quick Start).
** Routes from each Meraki branch connected via the Transit VPCs will be propagated throughout the SDWAN Segment with the future option to share these routes with additional Workload Segments.
** Each region deployed will include a Cloud WAN Core Network Edge (CNE) that will attach to the associated regional Transit VPC.
* Amazon Step Function State Machine to orchestrate the API calls to update the Cloud Wan CNP with any additional branch routes as they are discovered in the Meraki Dashboard.
* AWS Lambda works with Step Functions to update the CNP
* AWS Secrets Manager to store a Meraki API key. AWS Lambda uses the API key to access the Meraki dashboard when updating route tables.
* Amazon EventBridge to send events from each region to the Step Function State Machine when an update is needed
