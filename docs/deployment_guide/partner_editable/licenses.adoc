This deployment is not a warm spare configuration. It requires you to have at least two vMX licenses. If your organization has already reached its vMX license limit, you will be unable to create new vMX networks until a vMX network is deleted or additional licenses are added. For more information, see https://documentation.meraki.com/General_Administration/Organizations_and_Networks/Organization_Menu/License_Info_Page_-_Co-Termination_License_Model#Add_Another_License[Add Another License^]. If you do not have access to a vMX license or require additional vMX licenses, please reach out to your Meraki https://locatr.cloudapps.cisco.com/WWChannels/LOCATR/openBasicSearch.do[reseller^] or sales representative.
