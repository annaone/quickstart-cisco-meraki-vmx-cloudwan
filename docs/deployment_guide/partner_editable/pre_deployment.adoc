== Predeployment steps

This Quick Start assumes familiarity with the https://documentation.meraki.com/Getting_Started[Meraki dashboard^] and setting up a vMX appliance on AWS. For more information, see https://documentation.meraki.com/MX/MX_Installation_Guides/vMX_Setup_Guide_for_Amazon_Web_Services_(AWS)[vMX setup guide for Amazon Web Services (AWS)^].

=== Prepare your AWS account

==== Subscribe to the {partner-product-short-name} AMI
This Quick Start requires a subscription to the AMI for {partner-product-short-name} in AWS Marketplace.

. Sign in to your AWS account.
. Open the page for the {marketplace_listing_url}[{marketplace_subscription} AMI in AWS Marketplace^], and then choose *Continue to Subscribe*.
. Review the terms and conditions for software usage, and then choose *Accept Terms*. +
  A confirmation page loads, and an email confirmation is sent to the account owner. For detailed subscription instructions, see the https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/help/200799470[AWS Marketplace documentation^].
. When the subscription process is complete, exit out of AWS Marketplace without further action. *Do not* provision the software from AWS Marketplaceâ€”the Quick Start deploys the AMI for you.

=== Prepare your {partner-product-short-name} account
. Complete the instructions in the "Meraki Dashboard Configuration" section of the https://documentation.meraki.com/MX/MX_Installation_Guides/vMX_Setup_Guide_for_Amazon_Web_Services_(AWS)[vMX Setup Guide for Amazon Web Services (AWS)^]. During configuration, you generate authentication tokens for the vMX appliances. Copy and save the tokens. You must enter them in the `vMX1Token` and `vMX2Token` parameters in the AWS CloudFormation console during Quick Start deployment.
